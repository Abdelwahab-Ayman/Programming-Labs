 - 4.1 Objective
 This lab aims to train students on analyzing a problem, understand it, and
 determine the steps required to solve it pragmatically. Moreover, introduce
 the student to conditional statements, their role in a program, and when and

 ## 4.2 Problem
 - Write a program for a retail company that allows a user to enter a unit price
 and the number of units. Afterward, the program should calculate the total
 price. If the total price is less than 1000 Â£, the program should print a bill
 with an amount due that is equal to the calculated total price. Otherwise,
 the program should print a bill with an amount due that is equal to the
 calculated total price after applying a discount of 10%
